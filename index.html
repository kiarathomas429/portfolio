<h3><center>Only 3 percent of Americans in general, but 8 percent of Black Americans are vegan.
Whether it’s to reduce animal cruelty, manage a chronic illness, or connect with their
heritage and build a social movement, Black people are embracing plant-based diets.</center></h3>

<strong><h3><a href="#Audio Doc">They Can't Believe It's Vegan</a></h3></strong>
<p>Kiya Huffman became vegan in high school after watching a film about how animals are
turned into supermarket meat, lapsed because she found it difficult to maintain her diet in a meat-eating household, then became vegan again. Now she’s gently proselytizing the vegan lifestyle with
her catering business, selling vegan versions of BBQ pork and jerk chicken empanadas that
taste like the real thing.</p>

<strong><h3><a href="#Justice">Justice for All</a></h3></strong>
<p>Ties between social justice and animal rights go back to the civil rights era of the 1960s.
After George Floyd’s murder, a Los Angeles activist created an online community, Vegans
for Black Lives Matter. It’s been complicated.</p>

<strong><h3><a href="#Diabetes">He Cured His Diabetes by Swearing Off Goat</a></h3></strong>
<p>Michael Ngigi got a wakeup call when his father had a medical crisis and he learned that
diabetes runs in the family and that he had it too. Doctors told him the illness would never
go away, but after switching to a plant-based diet, all his disease markers had returned to
normal.</p>


  </article>
  <center><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p></center>

  <strong><center><span style="color:#EE3F00"><h3 id="Diabetes">He Cured His Diabetes By Swearing Off Goat</h3></strong></center></span>

  <p>In December 2019, Michael Ngigi’s father was visiting relatives in Kenya when he suddenly felt disoriented and mumbled incoherently. He was admitted to the ICU, but refused to get his vitals tested or have his blood drawn by doctors for blood tests to determine the cause of this episode, unless his sons would do the same. So they did. </p>

  <p>Ngigi, 36, discovered that his blood sugar and blood pressure were high. He went back to the hospital the next day to visit his father and see the doctor again. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. His body wasn’t producing enough insulin to regulate his sugar levels. </p>

  <p>The news hit him especially hard, because it did not come out of the blue. Type 2 diabetes ran in his family. He had witnessed his mom deal with the chronic disease for many years. Now his father was in the ICU with extremely high sugar levels and vitals that were “off the charts.” Ngigi was scared. His  first child had just been born. This was his wakeup call.</p>
  <p>“The first thing that the doctor said was, ‘It will never go away.’ And that made me feel furious,” he said. “I couldn't understand how I didn't have a way out. And so I decided that I was going to do everything I could. I was going to sacrifice everything I could to beat it.”</p>
  <p>Ngigi’s father was released from the hospital and Ngigi began self monitoring his glucose levels and blood pressure and keeping daily records.  He read about diabetes and treatments for the disease. He sifted through the information overload and misinformation on the Internet. He tried the keto diet, a low carb high and fat diet, and noticed that his health was going downhill fast. He said his blood pressure became worse, was disoriented and had a lot of anxiety. He came across an article about how eating a plant-based whole grains diet could help reverse diabetes and decided to try it out. And. It wouldn’t be easy: he was accustomed to eating meat, especially goat, every day on his family farm. But he hoped an abundance of fruits and vegetables would be his cure.</p>
  <p>Diabetes is on the rise, in Africa and around the world, according to the <a href="https://diabetesatlas.org" target="_blank">International Diabetes Federation</a>. And this illness is hitting Black people especially hard. In the United States, where more than 11% are diagnosed with diabetes and almost 13% of them are Black. The highest of any race, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/data/statistics-report/diagnosed-undiagnosed-diabetes.html"target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control</a>. In 2018, Black Americans were twice as likely to die from diabetes as whites, according to the <a href="https://www.minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&lvlid=18" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a>. They’re also more likely to suffer the worst consequences such as <a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2019-06/african-americans-diabetes-can-prevent-vision-loss.pdf" target="_blank">blindness</a> and <a href="Amputations.pdf" target="_blank">amputations</a>. Experts say structural inequities including inadequate access to health care and discrimination create these disparities. </p>

  <p>Black people tend to have less access to health insurance to pay for insulin and other diabetes medications, which means they dont always take it, or they skip doses, which makes their disease worse. But research suggests that diabetics may be able to control the disease, completely or in part, with something much simpler and more accessible: food. A 2021 Italian review <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8235036/"target="_blank">study</a> looked at 15 previous observational and randomized controlled studies, which examined the incidence rate of type 2 diabetes in vegans and people who ate a plant-based diet and how these diets impacted controlling glucose levels and diabetes-related complications in type 2 diabetes. The study found that people who eat a vegan diet are less likely to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and that plant based foods lowered glucose levels for those who had type 2 diabetes. </p>
  <p>“Type two diabetes used to be seen as a life sentence. Once you had it, there was no going back,” Victoria Moran, certified holistic health counselor said. “But we know now that that is not true…Choosing a plant based diet, getting regular exercise, taking care of our stress are the ways that we hedge our bets.”</p>
  <p>Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease that causes a person’s blood sugar to be high. This can cause hyperglycemia, or too much sugar in the blood. If left untreated this can cause damage to organs, blood vessels, tissues and nerves. Diabetes can happen when the pancreas doesn’t produce any or enough insulin, or “when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces,” according to the World Health Organization. Type 1 diabetes is a genetic condition where the cells in the immune system attack the cells in the pancreas causing little to no insulin to be produced. Type 2 diabetes is lifestyle-related. Insulin is needed to regulate blood sugar levels in the bloodstream by allowing the glucose to enter the cells and provide energy.  </p>
  <p>Diabetics are generally told to avoid foods that are high in saturated fat, trans fat, sodium, sweetener and sugar to lower their glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol levels, according to the <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/diet-eating-physical-activity#limit"target="_blank">National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</a>. Doctors recommend people who have diabetes are told to eat lean meats, chicken or turkey without the skin, and that at least half of their daily consumption of grains should be whole grains. Traditionally, type 2 diabetics are told to eat a low carb diet to decrease their blood sugar levels. But a 2021 <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.m4743" target="_blank">systematic review</a> showed that the first six months of a low carb diet worked, but afterwards the advantages decreased due to the diet being restrictive. People who ate a low carb diet had a 32% increase in diabetes remission compared to other diets.</p>

  <p>The reason why a vegan diet is a great option is because it’s well-rounded, Whitney Miner, certified holistic nutritionist and vegan health coach said.</p>

  <p>Foods that have simple carbohydrates, like milk products and high-fructose corn syrup, digest quickly and cause your blood sugar to spike. Fruits and vegetables have simple carbohydrates too, but they’re natural and rich in fiber. The fiber helps regulate blood sugar because it slows down digestion. This prevents a surge in blood sugar levels and is why a vegan diet is a great way to reverse type 2 diabetes, Miner said.  </p>

  <p>“Food will always be our first form of medication,” Kyhla Desire, a board member of the African American Diabetes Association, said. “There will never be a con to having a balanced diet that allows one to control their health. However, all questions of medication or healthcare plans should be addressed and discussed with a medical professional before any changes are made.”</p>

  <p>Can you add info on the kinds of specific foods, dishes and meals that Ngigi was eating and what he no longer ate? Would add some color to the story. When Ngigi was diagnosed he was over 200 pounds and stood at five feet and eight inches. He was obese, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute  <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmi-m.htm" target="_blank">BMI calculator</a>. He slimmed down to about 163 pounds after tk time of plant based eating. And at a doctors visit just under a year after his diagnosis, he learned that he had reversed his diabetes. He stopped taking his medication and continued a plant-based diet. His family members were influenced by his decision. His brother’s high blood pressure disappeared after following in Ngigi’s “foodsteps.”</p>

<strong><span style="color:#EE3F00"><h3>Transcription</h3></strong></span>
  <p><i><strong><span style="color:blue">[[Kiya Youtube video audio]]</span></strong></i></p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#dd1c77">Kiya Huffman:</span></strong>It smells like a piece of heaven. Alright. Literally, if heaven came down and sat right on my porch, that’s what it would smell like. You ready? Ya’ll ready? Let’s get it!</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:red">Kiara Thomas:</span></strong> That’s Kiya Huffman, the brains behind the Youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/VegansandVentures" target="_blank">Vegan and Ventures</a> and owner of vegan empanada business Empa[NAH]das. She’s reviewing the vegan mushroom truffle omelet from Smile of The Beyond in Jamaica, Queens. </p>

<p><i><strong><span style="color:blue">[[Kiya Youtube video audio]]</span></strong></i></p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#dd1c77">Kiya Huffman:</span></strong> This is their best seller. Ya’ll, this damn thing tastes good as hell! </p>

<p><strong><span style="color:red">Kiara Thomas:</span></strong> She started the channel in 2019 with her friend Josh McKenzie. </p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#dd1c77">Kiya Huffman:</span></strong> We used to go to so many vegan restaurants. I was like, I'm gonna start taking pictures of you in front of all of the vegan spots we go to, because he was a photographer too. And I was like, I'm a just put it in like a vegan book and so we can remember everywhere we went. And like literally like a few days later, I'm like, Why? Why would we just do that? Why not just go in there and review the food? Like, because that's what we was doing. We was going in there, sitting there talking to each other about the food and all that stuff. I'm like, Why don't I record? Like it, this is like good stuff.

<p><strong><span style="color:red">Kiara Thomas:</span></strong> On Youtube you can find videos of them tasting vegan food in Barcelona and London, doing a vegan hot wing challenge, and making vegan chicken using flour and water. When Josh went off to college, Kiya continued her vegan adventures including guests like her mom, to her videos. </p>

<p>Kiya attempted to be vegan twice. The first time was in twelfth grade more than 10 years ago. She had a teacher named Mr. Nelson for first period. He was vegan. He showed Kiya and her class videos of how animals are killed and their meat packaged for supermarkets. </p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#dd1c77">Kiya Huffman:</span></strong> From that first period, I stopped eating meat because I was like, Yo, I cannot be a part of this. It was harder for me then not to eat my family's food because I literally just did it cold turkey. Like I honestly and truly didn't even know what it was I was doing. I just knew that my body was telling me, you do not want to be a part of this? Like you can't do it. And like my family didn't even understand because we ain't know, you know, we didn't know what it was. Like we didn't know not to eat meat. That’s all we kind of grew up on type things </p>

<p><strong><span style="color:red">Kiara Thomas:</span></strong> Kiya grew up with her mom and Nana cooking collard greens, cornbread, fried chicken and sweet potato pie on Long Island. She found it difficult to stay away from their cooking, especially her childhood favorites. </p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#dd1c77">Kiya Huffman:</span></strong> It was extremely, extremely hard for me. But that's I would just eat things like that. Like I would just eat like, you know, the rice and or the vegetables and all that stuff. And I ended up eating meat again because my mom was just like, ‘All right, Kiya, I don't know what you want me to do. Like, you know, like, you need some food. You losing mad weight.’ So then I just ended up in meat again after that. </p>

<p><strong><span style="color:red">Kiara Thomas:</span></strong> Kiya’s second attempt started in 2017 when her cousin cut out meat. After being vegan for a few months all those years ago and the rising popularity of veganism in the media, she decided to give it a go. </p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#dd1c77">Kiya Huffman:</span></strong> Beyond Burger was coming out, you know, all that stuff. Like White Castle always had like vegan things there too. So around that time it was actually kind of – this time it was easier for me to not eat the meaty parts of my family's cooking.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:red">Kiara Thomas:</span></strong> She was first pescatarian before fully transitioning to be vegan in January 2022 at 29 years old. She is one of the many Black Americans, who are deciding to be vegan. A 2016 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2016/12/01/the-new-food-fights/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center survey</a>found that eight percent of Black Americans followed a strict vegan or vegetarian diet compared to the three percent of overall Americans. </p>

<p>Within the last couple of decades, books and films, like What The Health and The Omnivore’s Dilemma, and influencers like YouTuber Tabitha Brown brought healthy eating into the mainstream. And during the pandemic a lot of people started thinking more about their health. A 2021 <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/What-The-Future-Wellness.pdf" target="_blank">IPSOS survey</a> found that 62 percent of Americans said that their health was more important to them now than before the pandemic. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoriamoranauthor/details/education/" target="_blank">Victoria Moran</a> is a certified holistic health counselor and vegan lifestyle coach. She says this is partly linked to people becoming more aware of how chronic conditions can make COVID more serious. </p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#008080">Victoria Moran:</strong></span> I think that a lot of people who were in for the pandemic were doing a lot of research on what can I do not to get this? And we did see with the pandemic that preexisting conditions were really problematic. Obesity, type 2 diabetes, asthma, some of these kinds of things were very difficult when people did contract COVID.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:red">Kiara Thomas:</span></strong> Many people were also looking at plant-based meat alternatives during this time. A 2021 survey from the International Food Information Council said that most Americans ate plant-based meat alternatives in the past year.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#dd1c77">Kiya Huffman:</span></strong> I personally feel nobody can sit here and tell me that they never had like one vegan food item. Like it's literally everywhere. It’s at fast food restaurants that most people be going to, you know. A lot of black owned vegan businesses are starting to, you know, become like a big thing. Like it's just too easy for people not to have it now. And it's it's more out there than it was before.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:red">Kiara Thomas:</span></strong> The state of health in America hasn’t been the best, but specifically Black Americans have the highest rates of many chronic diseases. This includes high blood pressure and obesity. In 2020, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/black-health.htm" target="_blank">CDC</a> said the leading cause of death for Black people were heart disease, cancer, and COVID-19. </p>

<p>When Kiya was transitioning, her mom told her it was good that she was on the track to become vegan because chronic diseases ran in her family. </p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#dd1c77">Kiya Huffman:</span></strong> My mom had told me she had diabetes and like all the stuff that was going on, like, it just – it kind of just made me want to stick to it more. Like I was going with her to some of her like doctor appointments. And I would ask them like, you know, is not eating meat, is that like will that be like somewhat beneficial? And, you know, they would like explain like, yeah, you know, that actually that is kind of, you know, like a better route to go. </p>
<p><strong><span style="color:red">Kiara Thomas:</span></strong> Studies have shown that diet, stress, and genetics are connected to a person being diagnosed with a chronic disease. Researchers in a 2022 study published in <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-022-02256-w" target="_blank">BMC Medicine</a> examined almost 500,000 people from the UK over a 10 year period. They found that people who ate less meat or none at all lowered their risk of getting certain cancers. Researchers said that some cancers, like colorectal cancer, could be linked to diet. Many previous studies have come to the same conclusion.</p>

<p>With Black Americans having access to more processed foods, less healthy options, inadequate healthcare, and experiencing stress from structural racism, it isn’t a surprise that the state of Black health is suffering when compared to other races. <a href="https://adrianemiller.com" target="_blank">Adrian Miller</a> is a chef, author, and food historian. He says that the state of Black health is more than a food issue.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#1AA7EC">Adrian Miller:</strong></span> We've got cheap meat, we've got cheap calories and people are not having a balanced diet that is balanced with more fruit and vegetables and other things. So that's the food side of the story. But I think one part of the story that gets overlooked is the sustained exposure to racism environmentally and in other ways, and that definitely has health outcomes. And I think there's more and more appreciation for that, leading to things like high blood pressure and other things, you know, the constant stress brought about by external factors. </p>

<p><strong><span style="color:red">Kiara Thomas:</span></strong> Meat has become the center of food in America, but it hasn’t always been like that, especially for people of African-descent. Adrian says the diet of people in the African diaspora changed greatly from life before colonialism and slavery and afterwards. </p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#1AA7EC">Adrian Miller:</strong></span> When looking at West African kind of diets, most of it is very plant based and it's really starches that root the meal. So in parts of West Africa, there's an indigenous rice culture. And so a lot of meals were based on that. There are other places where it was based on things like sorghum and millet, black-eyed peas. And then you've got other parts where the root crops form the basis of the diet, so yams, plantains and cassava. And then later, after European contact and colonization, other plants from around the world start getting introduced. You've got cornmeal, you've got sweet potatoes and other things. And so but still, the diet was pretty much plant-based with protein as part of it, and usually especially in the coastal areas heavy reliance on seafood and then as you move to interior things like bushmeat and other things.

<p><strong><span style="color:red">Kiara Thomas:</span></strong> When Africans were enslaved, their diets were sort of replicated. On a plantation, enslaved people ate five pounds of a starch, which could be cornmeal, rice, or sweet potatoes. They also had a couple pounds of meat, which was usually smoked, dried or pickled. Usually this was pork. And then a jug of molasses. In addition to what their slaveholders gave them, enslaved people also foraged, hunted, gardened and fished for food – some of which they had to do in secret. Their diet was overall … </p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#1AA7EC">Adrian Miller:</strong></span> ...really plant based and meat was a luxury. And you know, this kind of follows the trajectory of American society. You see that for most of our country's history, people were eating a lot of plants and then as they aspire to, you know, class status and wealth, you get more and more meat entering the diet. To the point now where for a lot of people, the diet is very meat centric, even if they aren't necessarily, you know, prospering. Meat has become very cheap and available in the United States. So it's almost a complete movement away from the diet of West African ancestors to be something that's so meat centric. And that's the change that was brought on partly because of enslavement, also because in a new context, African-Americans, much like other Americans, were seeking class status and often meat consumption was a reflection of that.</p>

<p><i><strong><span style="color:blue">[[pan sizzling]]</span></strong></i></p>

<p><strong><span style="color:red">Kiara Thomas:</span></strong> Kiya wasn’t much of a chef during her veganism journey, yet she finds herself in the kitchen more these days as the owner of Empa[Nah]das. She makes plant-based empanadas inspired by cultural foods, like jerk chicken and barbecue pulled pork.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#dd1c77">Kiya Huffman:</span></strong> I see all my vegan food as all right, if I was trying to transition this person over, how like how realistic does it have to taste for them to be like, I can, I can stop eating meat. I can stop being a part of that process. You know, that kills animals and do this. That's how I see it. And I be try–, I season it to the T.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:red">Kiara Thomas:</span></strong> On a Friday afternoon, at a Bar Go Juice in Queens, Kiya holds a pop up shop. This is just the start of her busy weekend where she has events back-to-back. She talks to the people as they choose their empanadas and watches their reactions. Among the patrons is Peggy Luque, a Cuba-American vegetarian. She buys over a dozen empanadas. She says that finding Kiya and her vegan empanadas brings back memories of her childhood when her aunt would bring her family meat-filled empanadas from Jersey City.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#4B0082">Peggy Luque:</strong></span> It's tough being an Afro-Latina, man. We all eat meat and roast pork and you know, every day is something – arroz con pollo and pernil and I'm like [[sniffs]] but no I'm not I'm not tempted. I'm not tempted. It's all good. I'm in a happy place right now. And finding Kiya and her vegan empanadas is like, it's amazing as I miss them so much. </p>

<p><strong><span style="color:red">Kiara Thomas:</span></strong> Most of Kiya’s customers aren’t plant-based like Peggy, but they do resonate with some of her Caribbean and Southern empanada flavors. Kiya loves events like this, where she can go into a neighborhood and connect with the residents there. She surprises some of them with how flavorful plant-based foods can be. She shows them that people don't need to sacrifice their taste buds for healthier food. I see one of Kiya’s customers eating the jerk empanada. I ask him if he ever had a vegan empanada before. He said…</p>

<strong><span style="color:#FF6347">Customer 1:</strong></span> Nah this vegan? Nah it ain’t vegan. Yo this vegan?!</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#4B0082">Peggy Luque:</strong></span> It’s vegan!</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#006400">Customer 2:</strong></span> Yes!</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#FF6347">Customer 1:</strong></span> Nah, You fucked me up!</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#4B0082">Peggy Luque:</strong></span> Ahhhhh!</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#dd1c77">Kiya Huffman:</span></strong> Look at it right here. </p>

<p><strong><span style="color:red">Kiara Thomas:</span></strong> See?</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#dd1c77">Kiya Huffman:</span></strong> What that say?</p>

<strong><span style="color:#FF6347">Customer 1:</strong></span> She hit me up like – </p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#dd1c77">Kiya Huffman:</span></strong> The empanadas that make you say nah these can’t be vegan.</p>

<strong><span style="color:#FF6347">Customer 1:</strong></span> I’m like yo you’re on the wrong interview, ma. This shit is vegan?! Okay!</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:red">Kiara Thomas:</span></strong> I ask Kiya how she feels about the reactions she gets when people find out that her empanadas are vegan.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#dd1c77">Kiya Huffman:</span></strong> I love those reactions like I like to watch people just just – it's like I have to see it.</p>
